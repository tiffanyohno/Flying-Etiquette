# Flying-Etiquette

I chose this question because, as someone who takes a lot of flights and flew with family as a child, asking to switch seats on a flight to sit with family is both something that I have personally participated in and witness many times. I was pleased that the data revealed a majority of people surveyed do not view this as rude at all. While I can undersand the middle ground position as well, I think it makes sense that less than 2% of those inlcuded in the data set view this as a very rude action, as I believe it is not only typical, but often helpful even for those having to move-who wants to sit next to some random person's 8 year old for 5+ hours?
